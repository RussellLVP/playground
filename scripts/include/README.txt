Follow these steps in order to get the proper include files in this directory:

  (1) Download the latest version of the SA-MP server for Windows, which includes Pawno.
  (2) Extract the archive, and browse to the /pawno/include/ directory in a file browser.
  (3) Remove a_npc.inc, since we have no interest in the duplication.
  (4) Copy all the *.inc files to this directory.

We cannot include them for copyright reasons :-(.
